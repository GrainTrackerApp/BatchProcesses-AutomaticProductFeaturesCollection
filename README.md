# Grain Tracker ðŸŒ¾ 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and Firebase to provide security and to help to build and run successfully the app.

## The Project

Crushing of raw material is an important process step in mixed feed production. It leads to the required product structure, which is relevant for mixing and pelleting. In addition, crushing increases the particle surface area and thus also contributes to improved nutrient uptake by the animals.
In a compound feed mill, after the grain crushing process, the unbroken grain cereals are to be detected using an AI camera. In this systems engineering project, we developed a client-server system that automatically outputs the uncrushed grains via a USB StreamCam with an AI, so that engineers can subsequently use these results for optimal process parameter adjustment.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
